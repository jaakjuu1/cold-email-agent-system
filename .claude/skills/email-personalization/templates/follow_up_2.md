# Follow-Up Email 2 Template

## Template ID: follow_up_2_v1

### Purpose
Second follow-up, 5-7 days after first follow-up. Breakup or final attempt.

### Structure

```
Subject Line: Re: {original_subject}

Hi {first_name},

{acknowledge_no_response}

{final_value_point}

{breakup_or_alternative}

{signature}
```

### Guidelines

1. **Acknowledge No Response** (1 sentence)
   - Brief, non-judgmental
   - Show understanding of their busy schedule

2. **Final Value Point** (1-2 sentences)
   - Most compelling reason to respond
   - Strongest social proof or result

3. **Breakup or Alternative** (1-2 sentences)
   - Option A: Clear breakup email (closing the loop)
   - Option B: Offer alternative (different format, different ask)

### Breakup Email Example

```json
{
  "first_name": "Sarah",
  "original_subject": "Quick question about TechCorp's expansion",
  "acknowledge_no_response": "I know you're incredibly busy, so I'll keep this brief.",
  "final_value_point": "Our platform has helped 50+ engineering teams like TechCorp ship 40% faster. If improving developer velocity is a priority this year, I'd love to show you how.",
  "breakup_or_alternative": "If the timing isn't right, no worries at all – I'll close the loop on my end. But if you'd prefer, I can also send over a 2-minute demo video instead of scheduling a call.",
  "signature": "Best,\nJohn"
}
```

### Alternative Approach Example

```json
{
  "first_name": "Sarah",
  "original_subject": "Quick question about TechCorp's expansion",
  "acknowledge_no_response": "I realize a call might not be the best use of your time right now.",
  "final_value_point": "What if I sent a personalized 3-minute video walking through exactly how we'd approach TechCorp's specific setup?",
  "breakup_or_alternative": "No meeting required – you can watch it whenever works, and if it resonates, we can take it from there.",
  "signature": "Best,\nJohn"
}
```

### Timing
- Send 5-7 business days after follow-up 1
- Best sent earlier in the week (Monday-Wednesday)

### Key Principles
- Shortest email in the sequence
- Respect their time
- Give a clear out
- Consider alternative engagement methods
- Don't be desperate or passive-aggressive
